1. Install Visual Studio Code <br />

2. Install these extension within Visual Studio Code below (crtl+shift+x) <br />
	a. Jupyter <br />
	b. Python <br />
	Note: You may need to restart Visual Studio Code after installation <br />

3. Open my folder "EddieTran_AI_FinalProject" and make sure files are there below (crtl+o) <br />
	a. reddit_wsb.csv <br />
	b. NYSE_20211119.csv <br />

4. Run the code via "Run All" button <br />
	Note 1: One module seems to not be supported in python versions 3.7 and above, <br />
		but for some reason is working for me. I have commented out that module and <br />
		section of the code just to be safe. <br />

	Note 4: When pip installation has successfully installed, <br />
		you may need to restart Visual Studio Code for the IDE to update <br />
